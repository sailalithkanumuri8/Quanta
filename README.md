# Quanta
An FBLA Mobile Application Development Project
By Sai Lalith Kanumuri, Manvith Kothapalli, and Bryan Nie

## Abstract
Quanta will allow high school students to connect with their peers and share their high school portfolios. The portfolio will allow students to display their volunteer hours, courses, jobs, internships, research, projects, arts, athletics, and clubs/organizations they are part of. This enables students to share their high school resume with their peers, teachers, and parents without being intimidated by the achievements of more senior users like LinkedIn. The app has a homepage where they can keep track of major events like quarter ending, AP scores release, and more. It has a calendar that they can use to jot down important dates and events. The app also has a messaging feature so students can communicate with their peers about their portfolios. Overall, Quanta will enable students to be more confident about building their portfolios and sharing their high school experiences whilst expanding their network.

## Issue
We have struggled as high school students to connect and network professionally with other peers. But LinkedIn exists, right? However, LinkedIn isn't designed with high school students in mind, and using the app and seeing the achievements of more senior users can be intimidating. This is why we created Quanta, the new networking app that caters to the needs of high school students. We will show you the development process, our use and implementation of technology, and an app demo.

## Installation
```
TO VIEW ON MACOS
1.Install Xcode Dev Tools on the Apple App Store for Mac
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835
2. Follow instructions to download this repo as a .ZIP file
https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/
3. Find the project.pbxproj file inside the files. It will be in the Quanta.xcodeproj folder when you extract and view the parent folder.
4.After that, log in with your developer account.
5. All thats left is to choose a simulator of choice and build!
```

```
TO VIEW ON iOS
1. If you want to view the Quanta app directly on your iPhone, plug your phone into your Mac. In the simulator options you can use your phone as an option.
2. When running, you may get a prompt on your phone to approve the app. Along with that, ensure your phone meets the requirements of the app.

## Rapid Application Development Process
Throughout our time building the app, we used the Rapid App Development process, which allowed us to finish the app quickly, and seamlessly. We had many brainstorming sessions and collected many student accounts into what features to add to provide the most value. We would then design sketches and mock-ups on Canva and Figma, and then code them into reality. We finished each page one at a time and listened to a lot of feedback from our peers to again iterate our design and code. Then, finally, through multiple testing cycles, we finalized the app.

## Platforms
- SwiftUI
- UIkit
- Firebase(backend)

Our app is built with a bunch of different platforms. We namely used SwiftUI, UIkit, and Firebase.

SwiftUI is a programming language by Apple to easily make apps for apple devices. A big part of the app was made with this. However, SwiftUI lacks in some areas, so we also used UIkit. UIkit is another platform to make apps easily, and we used this to make our messaging feature. These two platforms are frontended, however.

The solution to that was using Firebase as well. We used Firebase for any backend processing not done solely on the device. We used Firebase to implement Google SSO technology, and to handle messages in our messaging feature.
